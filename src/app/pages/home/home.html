				Deployment as a Service on Hybrid Cloud is a solution for developers and enterprises which helps them leverage various cloud platforms for deployment of the application without worrying about deployment process. It is a platform which can deploy micro-services to cloud platforms. Our platform will help the enterprise to move from one cloud to another or private cloud to public cloud. On top of service, we also provide network and storage management layer so that a user could plug-and-play NFS or portable storage to different clouds.Once deployed, the enterprise can also use our platform to scale up or down according to the demand and need.Once deployed, the enterprise can also use our platform to scale up or down according to the demand and need.
